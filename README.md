Old project in python 3. Simple to use, download the repository, unzip it, put some english or morse code you want to hear or see translated and bam.

Update 2024:

refactored code so it's not so crappily done. Added optional playing audiofile in python. Have to do 'pip install playaudio'. 

Update again:

can change speed of audio file.
